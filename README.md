# SWHacks17-Healthcare
A healthcare application that patients and clinicians could use in figuring out what diseases they might have or what the root causes are for symptoms they might have been experiencing.

The project contains 3 parts - the iOS application, the Android application and the RESTful APIs that we developed.
